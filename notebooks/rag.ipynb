The problem here however, is that the continued XXXX dollars per month was never included towards the dept. They just very simply kept my monies without applying it towards the overall dept. Their explanation to me was that since I did not forward the latter XXXX, the XXXX dollars served as interest towards the dept. First, there was no practical reason for them to charge me an increase of XXXX, for missing one payment, and at no time had I violated any rule, regular, or policy of agreement, with this creditor. And was consistently paying over the minimal amount initially requested monthly. I want all those XXXX dollar payments accredited to my dept balance!
